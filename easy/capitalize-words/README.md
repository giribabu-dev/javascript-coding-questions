## Capitalize Words

Write a function that takes a sentence as input and returns a new sentence where the first letter of each word is capitalized,
and the rest of the letters are in lowercase.

Input: A string sentence containing one or more words separated by spaces.

Output: A new string where each word starts with an uppercase letter followed by lowercase letters.


# Example Inputs & Outputs
- Example 1:
    - Input: "hello world"
    - Output: "Hello World"

- Example 2:
    - Input: "javascript is FUN"
    - Output: "Javascript Is Fun"

- Example 3:
    - Input: "  multiple  spaces  "
    - Output: "Multiple Spaces"

- Example 4:

    - Output: ""


# Constraints & Edge Cases
- Input may have multiple spaces between words.
- Input may contain uppercase, lowercase or mixed-case characters.
- Input can be an empty string.
- Words can contain letters only: punctuation is not considered in this challenge.
- Leading / trailing spaces should be trimmed in the final result.
